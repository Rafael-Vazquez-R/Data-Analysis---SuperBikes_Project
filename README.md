This project examines the impact of annual members and casual riders on the future growth 
of the company. The financial department believes that converting casual riders into annual 
members will boost both profits and overall revenue.

The marketing analytics team aims to understand how casual riders and annual members use 
SuperBikes differently and why casual riders would be motivated to purchase a membership. 
To achieve this, they plan to analyze SuperBikes' historical bike trip data to identify 
usage trends. Based on these insights, the team will develop a new marketing strategy to 
encourage casual riders to become annual members, subject to approval by SuperBikes executives.

The objectives of the project are:

 - Maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders.
 - Understand the differences in how casual riders and annual members use SuperBikes.
 - Identify the key factors that would motivate casual riders to buy a membership.
